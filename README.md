## Introduction

Eztokenpass makes it easy to create an event page, set the event time, location, ticket type, and more. Before the event starts, the organizer can release NFTs to the participants or consumers and set them as validation tickets for the event. In this way, participants or consumers with specific NFTs can easily verify them at the event, and they can also be converted into QR codes through the product, which can be quickly scanned by the organizer or producer for verification.

At the same time, Eztokenpass supports all EVM-based block chains (e.g., Coin Security Chain, Ethernet Chain, etc.) as well as TVM-based chains, allowing users and communities of different chains to use Eztokenpass.

In addition, Eztokenpass provides rich event management functions, including registration management, participant verification, ticket setting, and more. These features allow organizers to manage events more easily and provide a better experience for participants and consumers.

Eztokenpass provides an NFT validation ticketing solution and also provides rich event management functions, allowing organizers to manage events more easily and participants or consumers to participate in events more conveniently and securely, enhancing the overall event experience and value.
